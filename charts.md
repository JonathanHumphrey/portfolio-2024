# Docs link for ApexCharts library

https://apexcharts.com/

## Flow

Charts.vue component is fed the options from their respective file in the util folder to keep the component clean and dynamic.

## Pitfalls

-   Each type of graph has a specific set of options that it needs, but all can be passed as chartOptions when the object format is created. All of the types of graphs have an example you can pull from in the docs.
