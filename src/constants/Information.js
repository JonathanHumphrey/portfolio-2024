      I enjoy understanding how and why things work, often approaching problems with a bottom-up perspective, which makes me an excellent collaborator because I like to understand everyone's perspective and challenges.
      I thrive on being creative and collaborating on challenging problems to find the best solutions.
      I am seeking opportunities to learn and gain experience in the development of client-facing applications.`,
